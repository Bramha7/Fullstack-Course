# ðŸ“¦ Fullstack Course - Backend Project

This is the backend part of a fullstack project I'm building as part of my course. It's powered by **Express.js**, uses **Sequelize ORM**, and connects to a **PostgreSQL** database. The goal is to build a fully functional REST API as I progress through the course.
This project is about book fetching,storing , deleting and updating when required.
